\section{Implementation of clockless AES}

A 32 bit datapath was chosen for the same reasons given in
\cite{ekelund}, assuming that the same reasoning can be used for
clockless design.

The resources used in the top level design is:
 4 8-bit s-box circuits, shared between the datapath and the keypath.
 1 32-bit mixcolumn circuit
 1 128-bit xor-adder circuit

Shiftrows and rotating is implemented by the means of wiring.
