\section{High-level languages and tools}
\label{sec:tools}

To design complex digital circuits, tools for reduction and management
of complexity is needed. Usually, the designer expres the behaviour of
circuits in a hardware description language (HDL), which provides an
abstraction over the underlying hardware. While ordinary design tools
and languages, such as VHDL and Verilog, are not usually used to
synthesize clockless circuits, there is not an inherent limitation in
the languages that prevents this as demonstrated in
\cite[pp. 135-137]{sparso}.

Much of the work on high-level modeling and synthesis of clockless
circuits is based on the CSP\nomenclature{CSP}{Communicationg
  Sequential Process} language paradigm. The CSP language,
``Communicating Sequential Process'' was proposed by Hoare \cite{csp},
and is based on the mathematical theories of concurrency from process
algebra. CSP-languages allows concurrent processes, composition of
both sequential and parallel statements within a process, and
synchronous message passing between the processes.

Tangram is a high-level language in the CSP family, introduced by
Philips in 1991 to define clockless circuits. The Tangram compiler
generates what is referred to as handshake circuits, and has its own
toolset and workflow as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:tangtool}. Tangram was later transferred from Philips
to the company Handshake Solutions, and the name of Tangram was
changed to Haste. As of this writing, Haste has entered a state of
maintenance, and has been readsorbed into Philips.

\end{figure}

Handshake circuits, first described in \cite{12, teakxxx}, consists of
40 different basic components that can be connected by four-phase
handshake signalling. The components has active and passive ports,
where the active components initiates the handshake and is said to
``push'' the data. Figure~\ref{fig:handbuffer}.b illustrates a
handshake circuit for a one-place buffer. Active ports are denoted
with a filled circle.

\end{figure}


To map handshake-circuits to hardware, the handshake components are
replaced by their gate-level equivalents, depending on implementation
style. Implementation styles can be bundled data, QDI, or even clocked
for e.g. verification on conventional FPGAs. Tangram is also a so
called syntax-directed language, meaning that each language construct
is deterministically mapped to a handshake-component. This allows the
designer to better understand and optimize circuits as they are
written. Tangram has been to implement fairly complex circuits,
including a clockless 80c51 processor\cite{80c51}.

Balsa\cite{tut} is another CSP-like language based on the priciples
from Tangram, and is an attempt to define a more expressive
language. Balsa also introduces a intermediate file format, breeze,
which contains the netlist for the handshake components. As shown in
figure~\ref{fig:balsaflow} Breeze handshake circuit files can later be
implemented into standard-cell logic by.

Tangram and Balsa are referred to as being a ``syntax-directed''
languages. This means that the silicon compiler transparently and
predictably generates components from each language construct. In
Figure~\ref{fig:handbuffer} it is shown how a simple Balsa-program is
translated into a handshake circuit. Each language-construct, loop,
sequence, transfer, and variable, are translated into handshake
components on a one-to-one basis.

Balsa has for example been used to implement two major circuits: The
DMA-controller for the Amulet3a processor, and the ARM-compatible SPA
processor itself. Balsa is released to the public domain under the
GPLv2 licence.

\label{par:init}
Initialization of variables in Balsa must be done explicit at
start-up, the same way as variables in ordinary programming
languages. The initialization is not performed with a global signal,
but is done locally at sub-modules, as the sub-modules are activated
by handshakes. Figure~\ref{fig:init} illustrates how initialization
can be defined at the source-code level.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{lstlisting}
procedure count16 (sync aclk; output count : nibble) is
variable count_reg : nibble
begin
  count_reg := 0;
  loop
    sync aclk ;
    count <- count_reg ;
    count_reg := (count_reg + 1 as nibble)
  end
end
\end{lstlisting}

Handshake component based designs has been shown to use little power,
but also to have low performance \cite{80c51}. Handshake-circuits
exhibit a control heavy structure which inhibits performace. Teak
\cite{teak} introduces a new target component set and synthesis scheme
for synthesizing Balsa circuits as an attempt to mitigate this
drawback. Instead of focusing on control

While Balsa-circuits consists of capacity-less channels, where data on
the channel has to be valid from request to acknowledge, Teak allows
buffers to be automatically inserted into the dataflow, allowing
decoupling. 

Teak circuits have been demonstrated to exhibit 4.6\% to 18.39\% worse
performance than Balsa-circuits when syntehsizing to a fixed gate
delay dual-rail four-phase implementation. However, Teak has a larger
headroom for automated optimising transformations.


Clockless circuits usually uses latches and C-elements for
memory. These memory-elements are not directly scanable, and they are
not connected to any global clock. However, in \cite{fullscan}, it is
shown how Tangram compiled, clockless circuits can be made scanable by
replacing all state-holding handshake components with scanable
equivalents. In Figure~\ref{scanC}, from \cite{fullscan}, a scanable
C-element is shown. These components are then connected into a serial
scan chain which is compatible with existing ATPG tools.

It is important to note that the scan-chain insertion is done at the
technology-mapping stage, allowing the designer to insert test-logic
into the library of components. For Balsa and Teak, this will require
some modifications of the compilers to chain the memory elements
together into a scan chain, and to provide a global testing clock.

As the testing is done synchronously, it also means that a global
clock have to be implemented. However, this clock has more relaxed
requirements than that of an clocked circuit, since the clock used for
testing runs at lower speeds than the circuit itself is capable of.
