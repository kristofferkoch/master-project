\section{Introduction}

Asynchronous/clockless circuits have different characteristics. Poser
Performance, EMI, modularity (no clock trees, design complexity),
robustness (bendable circuits, variable doping), future technologies
(non-silicon such as superconductors)

Wire-delays dominate. Clockless has overhead, is it worth it?

Clockless circuits assumes no common nor discrete time. ``A suffiently
expressive logic''

Young discipline. Testing is not widely researched.

But clocking has increasing complexity. Large worst-case windows.

DI and QDI?

Yada yada about high level design and its languages.

This project tries to explore different methods for synthesizing
clockless HDL.

\subsection{AES}

Reason for choice of AES for this thesis.
