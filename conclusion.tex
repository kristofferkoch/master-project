\section{Conclusion}

In this project, methods for creating circuits without clocks have
been researched, and a clockless AES-module have been implemented to a
netlist comprising of primitive gates, using the Balsa language and
Teak synthesis system. Well founded theoretical foundations were
found, but the found workflows for implementing clockless circuits,
while able to implement circuits, were not found to be as stable and
complete as their clocked counterparts. Clockless circuits have
special properties, and should be considered when the goals are low
power, low electromagnetic emissions, secure crypto implementations
and robustness to operating conditions.

\subsection{Further work}

A clockless AES module was developed in this project, with the purpose
of testing tools for clockless development. While testing have been
implemented for the Tangram tool flow, the alternatives employed in
this project lacks support for this kind of testing. It should be
possible to implement testing both in Balsa and Teak.

Furthermore, technology-mapping and place \& route need further
research to explore the clockless methodology. Power estimation is
also important to assess how design choices affect power consumption

With Teak, new possibilites for automatic optimization opens up, and
is clearly an area for further research.
